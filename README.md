A web-based implementation of the classic Simon memory game.

## Introduction

Simon is a popular memory game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for decades. The game consists of a circular device with four colored buttons that light up in a specific sequence. Players must watch and remember the sequence, then repeat it back by pressing the buttons in the correct order.

This project is a web-based implementation of the Simon game, created using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. The game includes all of the key features of the original game, including randomized button sequences, visual feedback, and a "strict" mode for added difficulty.


## Installation

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

## Usage

To play the game, simply click any button on your keyboard to begin. The game will display a sequence of colored buttons, which will light up in a specific pattern. Watch and remember the pattern, then repeat it back by clicking the buttons in the correct order. Each time you successfully repeat the pattern, the game will add another button to the sequence. If you make a mistake, the game will display an "Game Over" and you'll need to start over from the beginning.
